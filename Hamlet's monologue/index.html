    <h1>Speech: “To be, or not to be, that is the question”</h1>
    <h3>BY <a href="#">WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE</a></h3>
    <p>(<i>from</i> Hamlet, <i>spoken by Hamlet</i>)</p>
    <p>
        To be, or not to be, that is the question: <br>
        Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer<br>
        The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,<br>
        Or to take arms against a sea of troubles<br>
        And by opposing end them. To die—to sleep,<br>
        No more; and by a sleep to say we end<br>
        The heart-ache and the thousand natural shocks<br>
        That flesh is heir to: 'tis a consummation<br>
        Devoutly to be wish'd. To die, to sleep;<br>
        To sleep, perchance to dream—ay, there's the rub:<br>
        For in that sleep of death what dreams may come,<br>
        When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,<br>
        Must give us pause—there's the respect<br>
        That makes calamity of so long life.<br>
        For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,<br>
        Th'oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely,<br>
        The pangs of dispriz'd love, the law's delay,<br>
        The insolence of office, and the spurns<br>
        That patient merit of th'unworthy takes,<br>
        When he himself might his quietus make<br>
        With a bare bodkin? Who would fardels bear,<br>
        To grunt and sweat under a weary life,<br>
        But that the dread of something after death,<br>
        The undiscovere'd country, from whose bourn<br>
        No traveller returns, puzzles the will,<br>
        And makes us rather bear those ills we have<br>
        Than fly to others that we know not of?<br>
        Thus conscience does make cowards of us all,<br>
        And thus the native hue of resolution<br>
        Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought,<br>
        And enterprises of great pitch and moment<br>
        With this regard their currents turn awry<br>
        And lose the name of action.<br>
